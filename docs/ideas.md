# AgentDeck ideas and improvements

This is a place to keep future thoughts without accidentally treating them as promises or approved
work. The specifications describe the product today; this file does not.

## New ideas

Put a half-formed thought here. It needs only a short title and, if useful, a sentence about what
prompted it.

Example:

```md
- **Pinned agents.** Let people keep frequently used agents at the top of the dashboard.
```

- **Projects page problems (new design).** Remaining redesigned-projects-page issues (the context
  menu and six-preset colors were promoted to
  `docs/ready-changes/project-context-menu-and-preset-colors.md`; "create a new project from the
  projects page" moved to Ideas being defined):
  1. The new design looks bad and needs rework.
- **Fix card drag-and-drop usability.** Dashboard card reorder (FS-02.R12) technically works but
  reads as broken: the drag listener is bound only to the tiny 28×28px `::` handle
  (`AgentCard.tsx`), not the card itself, so dragging the card body does nothing — and because the
  card's `onClick` navigates to the agent, a failed drag attempt looks like an accidental page
  change. Dropping a card onto another group's section also doesn't move it between groups (`order`
  is one flat array independent of `group`), so it silently snaps back. Needs whole-card drag (with
  an activation distance so a plain click still opens the agent) and either real cross-group drop
  support or a clear affordance that drag only reorders within a group.

### From play session 2026-08-10

- **Crash protection for bad projects.** AgentDeck created invalid projects that broke the process.
  Add input validation on project creation and guard the process against malformed project state.
- **Response spinner.** Show a spinner/indicator while waiting for an agent response, so it's clear
  an answer is coming and the process isn't stuck — like Claude and Codex.
- **Copy-pastable messages.** CSS currently blocks text selection in the transcript. Remove it so
  people can mark text, copy it, and send it out as tasks, etc.
- **Adjustable chat window size.** Let the chat window be resized.
- **Sending a message resumes the conversation.** Sending a message to an idle/exited agent should
  resume its conversation rather than requiring a separate resume action.
- **Edit message (fork on older).** Like Codex: editing the most recent message edits it in place;
  editing any older message forks/copies the conversation from that point (this is the "split
  conversation" mechanism).
- **File and skill autocomplete.** Like Codex/Claude/Cursor: typing `@` opens a project file searcher
  autocomplete; typing `#` opens a skill-trigger autocomplete.
- **'Approve for me' mode.** Like the agents already have — just expose the toggle, with the default
  persisting to whatever was last selected.

## Ideas being defined

These are worth shaping into a possible change, but are not ready to build. Defining an idea updates
the relevant feature and technical specifications; it does not change product code.

- **Real-provider acceptance.** Run the credentialed OpenCode/OpenHands and Claude/Codex federation
  checks, then reconcile any observed provider incompatibility before making release claims.
- **AgentDeck product knowledge MCP.** Define a versioned, non-secret `agentdeck_docs` topic service
  for AgentDeck roles, including ownership, registration, and acceptance checks.
- **Detached configuration import.** Define verified copyable fields/assets and provider injection
  paths before implementing detached import.
- **Activity map.** Explore a repository/session activity view using server APIs only, with clear
  privacy, scale, and normal-user value boundaries.
- **API authentication / multi-user boundary.** Revisit local API authentication only with an
  explicit threat model and UI/CLI handshake design.
- **Operational CLI.** Complete the specification for dashboard control, install/update, pidfile
  concurrency, and actionable startup diagnostics.

## Known things to improve

These describe incomplete or deliberately limited shipped behavior. Their owning specification is
the authority; move an item to ready changes only after its exact requirements and acceptance checks
are clear.

- **Local API authentication.** The loopback API currently relies on same-machine trust. Revisit a
  token or browser/UI handshake only if the security benefit outweighs its setup and compatibility
  cost.
- **Child-process environment.** Agent processes currently inherit the full environment except for
  backend strip keys. Revisit an allowlist only if it can preserve required provider compatibility.
- **Chat history fidelity.** Make replayed streaming deltas match live deltas; prevent overlapping
  transcript reloads from winning out of order; show initial-load errors.
- **Archive and tracking usability.** Add UI pagination; refresh visible files/commands without
  stale-request overwrite; and let hook-only activity update recency.
- **Cross-turn transcript search.** Turn-document indexing intentionally chooses a small design over
  the more complete segmented model: all query terms and quoted phrases must occur within one turn,
  annotation flush, metadata document, or migrated legacy document. It does not combine a term from
  one turn with a term from another, does not match a phrase across turn boundaries, and one
  pathologically large turn can still use substantial temporary memory. Revisit with size-bounded
  chunks, boundary overlap, and per-term session aggregation only if real sessions show oversized
  individual turns or users repeatedly fail to find conversations because their query spans turns;
  those additions otherwise impose more schema, ranking, pagination, and phrase-boundary machinery
  than the observed long-session rewrite problem warrants.
- **Coordination liveness.** Scope nudge cooldowns to a generation, limit repeated nudges, republish
  unread counts after janitor expiry, notify only on the first budget breach, and remove duplicate
  permission notices.
- **Terminal capability honesty.** Codex works as a chat backend, but its terminal interface is
  intentionally rejected until a Codex-specific interactive-CLI hook/flag path is verified; terminal
  agents are not messageable for the same reason. Also either add an optional driver picker or stop
  advertising unreachable drivers; implement or retire the planned tab cap; and bound aggregate
  shutdown grace across multiple agents.
- **Federation UI and watches.** Expose custom roots/profiles, refresh the effective view after
  source events, register prompt watches after binding, and clear preview consent on project change.
- **Backend launch diagnostics.** Use executable overrides consistently, bound ACP readiness,
  and provide provider-specific missing/old CLI guidance.
- **HTTP compatibility.** Decide and specify how mixed legacy error envelopes should converge.
- **Frontend state ownership.** Define Zustand/React Query ownership and mutation-error behavior
  before broad frontend refactors.
- **Lifecycle and process hardening.** Corroborate process identity, scope crash cleanup by
  generation, serialize concurrent events, and define/test detached-start pidfile races.
- **Local filesystem hardening.** Decide whether startup repairs existing descendant modes and
  whether valid-name role/project files may be symlinks; add adversarial tests for the chosen rules.
- **HTTP request-size limits.** Define shared JSON request limits and the structured over-limit error
  before enforcing them.
