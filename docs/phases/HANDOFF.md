# AgentDeck — Implementation Handoff

**Live state. Read this first, every session. Update it after every change.**
Protocol: [`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md) (Claude Code or Codex, whichever the human runs).
Keep this lean — apply the condensation rules (workflow §5); old detail lives in git, not here.

---

## Current position

- **Active phase:** 3 — Config CRUD & onboarding
- **Active subphase:** 4.1 — Archive + search (Phase 4 first subphase)
- **Spec:** Phase 3 complete ✅. See Phase 4 spec when available.
- **Last GREEN checkpoint:** review-fix @ `impl/phase-3`: 26 Vitest + go tests green (path-traversal fix + cache invalidation + force-delete UI)
- **Branch:** `impl/phase-3` (do not commit to `main`; do not push unless asked).

---

## Phase status

- [x] Phase 0 — Foundation (data model, file store, server & CLI skeleton) ✅
- [x] Phase 1 — Core loop (ACP chat runtime, launch, streaming chat) ✅ — verified against real `claude-code-acp` v0.16.2
- [x] Phase 2 — State manager, SSE bus, dashboard card grid ✅
- [x] Phase 3 — Config CRUD & onboarding ✅
- [ ] Phase 4 — Persistence: archive, search, resume, file/command tracking
- [ ] Phase 5 — Coordination: MCP messaging, nudger, budgets, notifications
- [ ] Phase 6 — Flexibility: terminal runtime, switch-runtime, task groups
- [ ] Phase 7 — Polish: activity map

Build order: `0 → 1 → 2 → {3, 4, 5} → 6 → 7` (3/4/5 are independent after 2).

## Active subphase detail

> The ONLY place granular steps live.

**Phase 2 complete ✅** (2.1–2.6 green; details in git history).

**Subphase 3.1 ✅** — `internal/config/validate.go` (`ValidSlug`, `FieldError`, role/project validators); `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/roles/{role}` + `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/projects/{project}` with `validation_failed` shape, `cwd_not_found` warning, in-use guard (`?force=true`); disk-on-demand confirmed; all tests green.

**Subphase 3.2 ✅** — `internal/backend/credcheck/` (dispatch, claude.go auth-status probe, codex.go /v1/models ping, 6s timeout, CredResult); `ValidateBackendsConfig` in validate.go (invariants 1–6, auto-promote zero-default backend + model); `PUT /api/backends` handler with cred-check injection for tests; env merge tested. All tests green.

**Subphase 3.3 ✅** — `GET /api/config` with computed `onboarding` block (min-viable check: backend ok-creds + project + role, ~60s cred-check cache); `PUT /api/config` partial merge (onboarding_complete, defaults; rejects version/port); `Config.OnboardingComplete` field added to types.go; disk-on-demand audit: all reads hit disk per request, only the cred-check memo is cached. Tests green.

**Subphase 3.4 ✅** — Zod schemas (role/project/backends/config); TanStack Query hooks (`useRoles`/`useProjects`/`useBackends`/`useConfig` + mutations); `SettingsPage` tabs; `RolesEditor`+`RoleForm` (tri-state skip_permissions); `ProjectsEditor`+`ProjectForm` (RGB swatch, cwd_not_found warning); Settings route wired; Vitest+MSW tests (11 green); embedded dist refreshed.

**Subphase 3.5 ✅** — `BackendsEditor`+`ModelRow` (default radios, env editor with masked secrets, cred chip on save); `useSuggestedName` (auto-suggests until user edits); `NewAgentModal` (role/project/backend/model selects, auto-name, terminal disabled, submits `POST /api/sessions`); `CardGrid` wires "New agent" button + `EmptyState` CTA; 20 Vitest+MSW tests green; embedded dist refreshed.

**Subphase 3.6 ✅** — `OnboardingGate` (reads `GET /api/config` onboarding.satisfied, blocks dashboard); `OnboardingWizard` 3 steps (BackendStep: validate & continue on ok creds; ProjectStep: POST /api/projects; LaunchStep: POST /api/sessions + PUT /api/config onboarding_complete); resume-from-first-not-done-step; non-dismissible (Esc/overlay blocked); 26 Vitest tests green; embedded dist refreshed. **Phase 3 COMPLETE.**

**Phase 3 complete ✅** (3.1–3.6 all green; details in git history).

## Decisions & notes (durable contracts from Phase 1)

- **Normalized `Event` is the cross-phase contract.** `internal/runtime`: `event.go` (envelope +
  `*Data` payloads), `acpmap.go` (the ONLY place ACP wire shapes are decoded — §12.1 isolation rule).
  Phase 2 streams these `Event`s as `new_message` payloads; the interim SSE `data:` object is already
  byte-identical to what Phase 2 wraps. Permanent fields: `agent_id,seq,type,ts,data` (append-only).
- **`Registry` is the server's entry to runtimes** (`Launch`/`SendPrompt`/`Cancel`/`Stop`/`Permission`/
  `Subscribe`/`Shutdown`; dispatch by `agent.interface`; `Chat()` + `ChatRuntime.SetCommand` inject the
  adapter binary). `chat.go` owns `agentState` per agent (process group, transport, hub, status writes);
  `permission.go` is the withhold-the-response gate; `reconcile.go::ReconcileStale` cleans stale rows on start.
- **Status vocabulary (§4.4)** is the dashboard contract Phase 2 reads: `state ∈
  {busy,idle,waiting_input,done,error}`, `last_trace ∈ {SessionStart,UserPromptSubmit,PreToolUse:*,
  PostToolUse:*,PermissionRequest:*,PermissionResolved,Stop,Cancelled,Error}`.
- **REST surface (server pkg):** `POST /api/sessions` (launch), `GET /api/sessions/{id}`,
  `POST .../{prompt,cancel,stop,permission}`, `GET .../events` (interim SSE). Session routes use the §7.7
  nested error envelope via `writeAPIError`. `server.New` takes a `*runtime.Registry`. CLI launch
  (`internal/cli/launch.go`) just POSTs to `/api/sessions` (CLI≡modal parity).
- **fakeacp** (`internal/runtime/testdata/fakeacp`) is the deterministic test adapter — under `testdata/`
  so `go build ./...` skips it; build explicitly with `go build -o /dev/null ./internal/runtime/testdata/fakeacp`.
- The **real-CLI acceptance** is gated behind `//go:build acceptance` (5 tests: stream, permission
  deny/approve, cancel, stop); run with `go test -tags acceptance ./internal/runtime -run TestRealCLI -v`
  (needs `claude-code-acp` + a logged-in Claude account). Recipe + Appendix A: [`phase-1-acceptance.md`](phase-1-acceptance.md).

## Blocked on human

_(empty — the 1.6 credentialed acceptance ran GREEN against `claude-code-acp` v0.16.2. Nothing blocking.)_

## Review findings (BLOCKING items from the last review)

> Written by the review agent (workflow §8). Remove an entry once fixed and verified green.

- ✅ **RESOLVED — path-param slug validation added to all PUT/DELETE handlers.** `handlePutRole`, `handleDeleteRole`, `handlePutProject`, `handleDeleteProject` now call `config.ValidSlug(id)` before any store call; non-slug ids return `validation_failed` 400. `TestPathTraversalRejected` + `TestPathTraversalEncodedDots` added and green.

- ✅ **RESOLVED — Phase 2.6 committed + review advisories fixed.** 2.6 chat panel is now a committed
  green checkpoint. Fixed alongside it: PermissionPrompt collapses to an Approved/Denied chip after a
  decision (resolved state stored per `tool_call_id`); TranscriptView autoscrolls with a jump-to-latest
  affordance; CardContextMenu closes on click-outside/Escape; `resolvePermission` now uses its
  `toolCallId`; CardGrid skips the layout PUT on initial load; and `ToolCall`/`ToolResult`/`TurnError`
  renderers added (collapsible args, truncated results). Embedded `internal/server/ui/dist` re-synced.

- ✅ **RESOLVED — advisory: onboarding cred-check cache invalidated on PUT /api/backends.** `handlePutBackends` now clears `onboardingCache` after every successful write, ensuring a changed API key is always re-probed on the next `GET /api/config` rather than serving a stale ok/failed result for up to 60s.

- ✅ **RESOLVED — advisory: force-delete UI flow added to RolesEditor and ProjectsEditor.** DELETE 409 responses are now caught; the UI parses `body.agents`, shows a confirm listing affected agents, and retries with `?force=true` if the user confirms. Running agents are unaffected per the spec.

- ✅ **RESOLVED — full real-adapter Appendix A coverage added & PASSED.** The gated acceptance suite
  (`internal/runtime/acceptance_test.go`, `//go:build acceptance`) now has five real-CLI tests, all green
  against `claude-code-acp` v0.16.2 (`go test -tags acceptance ./internal/runtime -run TestRealCLI -v`):
  `TestRealCLIAcceptance` (incremental stream + turn_end + idle), `TestRealCLIPermissionDeny` (real gate;
  denied tool's side effect never happens), `TestRealCLIPermissionApprove` (approved tool runs),
  `TestRealCLICancel` (cancel interrupts an in-flight turn → idle), `TestRealCLIStop` (terminates the
  process group + removes the running row + status `done`). Confirmed real option kinds are
  `allow_once`/`reject_once`/`allow_always` — `selectOption` (§5.3) maps approve/deny correctly.

## Autonomous decisions (please review)

> Resolved without stopping; the human should still see them. Remove once acknowledged (workflow §3, §5).

- **`internal/store` (spec) → `internal/state` (Phase 0 reality).** The runtime imports `internal/state`
  throughout; the spec's `store` is the older name for the same package. No behavior change.
- **`Stop` implemented in 1.3** (spec slots it in 1.4) for test teardown — matches §8.5 exactly; no reversal needed.
- **Tool `Name` ← ACP `kind`** (fallback `title`, then `"tool"`); §4.3 didn't pin the field. Isolated in
  `acpmap.go::toolName`. Verified against the real adapter (turn streamed cleanly).
- **RESOLVED in 2.2: hook token persisted in `running.hook_token`.** `Server.hookTokens` still exists as
  Phase 1 launch scaffolding but hook validation now reads the live `running` row, not the map.
- **Two error-envelope shapes coexist** — new session routes use the §7.7 nested shape; Phase-0 GET routes
  keep flat `{"error":"msg"}` (not migrated, to avoid breaking Phase-0 tests). Migrate later if §7.7 is meant
  to be truly project-wide.
- **`messagingServer.Command = os.Executable()`** with `["mcp-stdio","--agent",ID,"--token",T]` —
  registration-only; the `mcp-stdio` subcommand lands in Phase 5.
- **NEW: runtime strips `CLAUDECODE` from the spawned adapter's env** (`chat.go::stripEnv`). The real
  `claude-code-acp` refuses a "nested" session when `CLAUDECODE` is set (true when AgentDeck is launched
  from a Claude Code terminal). AgentDeck spawns independent agents, so the nested guard must never apply.
  Discovered during the 1.6 run. **To reverse:** drop the strip if it ever causes surprise; production
  (standalone server) is unaffected since `CLAUDECODE` isn't set there.
- **RESOLVED: `CLAUDE_ACP_VERSION` pinned to `0.16.2`** (was an unverified `0.4.1` placeholder; corrected
  via `npm view` to the real latest-stable, against which acceptance passed).
- **Wire-shape note (no fix needed):** the real adapter's `session/new` ignores our `model` param and
  exposes its own modelIds (`default`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`opus`) + permission `modes`
  (incl. `bypassPermissions`/`acceptEdits`). Phase 1 doesn't assert the model, so this is fine; a future
  phase wanting real model/mode selection should map our model→adapter modelId in `acpmap.go`/`sessionNewParams`.
- **Phase 2.1 manager contract:** `state.Manager` wraps the existing Phase 0 `Store`; it does not replace
  typed CRUD. It emits `AgentStateUpdate` through `StatePublisher`, now implemented by `internal/bus`.
  `status.updated_at` is migration v2, `running.hook_token` is migration v3, and `Store.WriteStatus` stamps
  `updated_at` when callers omit it.
- **Phase 2.1 transcript mirror kept generic.** The spec asked for transcript types in `internal/state/types.go`
  but Phase 1's concrete normalized event shapes already live in `internal/runtime/event.go`. I added only
  `state.TranscriptEvent {Kind, Data}` as a storage/UI-facing mirror to avoid duplicating runtime structs.
  To reverse: replace it with concrete state-owned transcript structs when 2.4/2.6 needs them.
- **Phase 2.3 kept runtime Hub internally.** The HTTP route `GET /api/sessions/{id}/events` is deleted and
  transcript deltas now publish as bus `new_message`, but `Runtime.Subscribe`/per-agent `Hub` still exist for
  runtime tests and local internal compatibility. To reverse: remove the hub API once no tests/internal callers need it.
- **Phase 2.4 replaced the walkthrough UI source.** The repo had a product-demo React app, not the dashboard shell
  scaffold described by the spec. I replaced `ui/src` with the Phase 2 shell/stores/SSE foundation and refreshed
  `internal/server/ui/dist`. To reverse: recover the demo from git history, but it is no longer the Phase 2 target UI.

  (permission deny/approve, cancel, stop) alongside the stream test — all 5 PASS against
  `claude-code-acp` v0.16.2. Real option kinds confirmed (`allow_once`/`reject_once`/`allow_always`).
  Resolves the BLOCKING review finding. Default suite untouched (tests tagged off).
- 2026-06-28 — **Phase 1 COMPLETE.** Real-CLI acceptance PASSED against `claude-code-acp` v0.16.2:
  handshake + incremental stream + turn_end + idle. Fixed: runtime strips `CLAUDECODE` from the spawned

  prompt/cancel/stop/permission) + interim SSE + CLI launch. Tests: composeEnv/joinSystemPrompt/resolveSkip
  units, CLI parseLaunch + parity, full HTTP integration (launch→SSE→prompt→permission_request→approve→
  sentinel→turn_end), §7.7 validation/404 envelopes. Replaced the Phase-0 CLI launch stub.
- 2026-06-27 — **1.4 green** (incl. `-race`). Permission gating (withhold/approve/deny/timeout/skip),
  Cancel, crash handling, stale-row reconcile. Tests: approve→sentinel, deny→no sentinel, timeout auto-deny,
  skip auto-approve, unknown-tool 409, cancel-during-pending, crash (fatal err + running row deleted), reconcile.
- 2026-06-27 — **1.3 green.** Real `ChatRuntime`: process-group spawn + ACP handshake, isolated
  `acpmap.go`, per-agent `Hub` (drop-oldest), async `SendPrompt` streaming a turn end-to-end, §4.4 status
  writes, working `Stop`. Tests (incl. `-race`): `stream_text` (multi-delta + monotonic seq + context_pct),
  `tool_flow` (correlated call/result/diff), idle→busy→idle. fakeacp gained `tool_flow` + usage in result.
- 2026-06-27 — **1.2 green.** Added JSON-RPC stdio transport (8 MiB scanner, serialized writer, Call/Notify,
  correlation map, IncomingRequest withhold/Respond) + standalone fakeacp CLI (stream_text/big_frame/
  malformed_then_valid). Tests: >64 KiB frame, malformed-then-valid resync, Call/response, incoming-request reply.
- 2026-06-27 — **1.1 green.** Created `internal/runtime`: sentinel + APIError/code vocab, Event envelope +
  payload structs, Runtime interface, Registry dispatch + terminal/ChatRuntime stubs. Tests: payload JSON
  round-trips, code→status map, dispatch table. `go build ./...` + `go test ./...` green.
- 2026-06-27 — Handoff + workflow created. Phase 0 confirmed complete (build + tests green). Phase 1 ready to start at 1.1.
