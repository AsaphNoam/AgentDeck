## Current position

- **Active change:** None.
- **Release:** `v0.4.3` is tagged and published; **Release state** and the release record carry its
  contents. `v0.4.2` and earlier are in the state archive.
- **Review units:** none available. `persistent-pipeline-orchestration` was reviewed 2026-09-13 and
  closed the same day when its fixes landed; that fix commit is part of its closure and is not a new
  review unit. `stop-telling-agents-to-poll` shipped without entering this queue on
  the operator's explicit 2026-09-10 instruction; it can be added later.
- **Work units:** `rename-product-to-deckhand.md` is Waiting to start: the AgentDeck → Deckhand rename with its
  one-time state migration, role rename to FirstMate, and two named read-compatibility paths.
  `migrate-internal-actions-from-mcp.md` stays paused on its transport
  blocker; the ACP wait-list in `docs/ideas.md` holds the rest behind an adapter contract.
  Queue hygiene: `bump-pinned-acp-adapters.md` reads `State: Finished` but is still in
  `docs/ready-changes/` and absent from that directory's index; per its README a finished change's
  file is removed. Left in place rather than deleted unasked.
- **Design units:** `Ideas being defined` entries may resume; `New ideas` entries are available.
  Persistent pipeline orchestration and its mail extension are implemented, reviewed and fixed.
  TS-01.R31–R33, TS-02.R34 and TS-04.R53 complete shared prompt preparation, bounded batches,
  transactional budget/read settlement, uncertain-delivery recovery and deferred retention.
  The design decisions for clean legacy reset, descendant cancellation, project boundaries,
  subordinate coordination and ordinary stop/resume remain confirmed; implementation gaps are
  recorded below. Streaming agent thinking stays part-decided (live-only decided; rendering default and whether
  `plan` ships still open). The permanently unaddressable pipeline agent is the newest `New ideas`
  entry and needs `/design-feature` before code. The Deckhand rename is fully specified and promoted
  to the work queue; no design decision remains open for it.
- **Open findings:** `persistent-pipeline-orchestration` is closed; all fourteen findings are fixed
  with regression tests. Still open in BR-1: the unverified OpenCode/OpenHands paths. Live-gate
  finding durability and provider-contract oracles are fixed. The injected-steer lifetime edge
  case is named here but was never recorded as a finding; it needs `/investigate-bug` before `/fix`
  can take it. See **Review findings**.
- **Bug reports:** BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3 are investigated and archived with this release; BR-3 is
  fixed and closed. BR-1's Codex model/effort defect is fixed and reviewed; BR-2 is fixed and closed.
  BR-1's still-open findings are listed above. Pinned Claude model delivery
  through `_meta` works; an ACP model `currentValue` can be stale and is no execution-model oracle.
- **State:** The file viewer's credentialed rendered forms are owed: journey J3 now carries the
  file-link steps (docked and transcript-width forms, the refusal branch, the dashboard-pane
  navigation), and none of them has been exercised against a real browser.
  Automated MCP contract verification is green. The full post-fix Claude/Codex acceptance
  matrix remains open and must not be called verified; the 2026-09-08/09 probes were limited contract
  and model-delivery checks, not that matrix. Real Claude and Codex steering is unexercised.
- **Branch:** `main`.

## Active change

**Change:** `/fix` on BR-1. Findings 1 (live-gate durability) and 2 (provider-contract oracles) are
closed; finding 3 (OpenCode/OpenHands) follows. Settled 2026-09-13 changelog entries moved to
[`HANDOFF-through-2026-09-13`](../archive/state/HANDOFF-through-2026-09-13.md).

**Changelog — 2026-09-13 (fix: BR-1 provider-contract oracles):** TS-04.R54 states the three rules
that separate a contract claim from a restatement of AgentDeck's own intent. The pinned ACP
session-request member set is now transcribed from the protocol schema and compared against
`sessionNewParams`/`sessionLoadParams`, with each backend's surviving out-of-schema members declared
and backend types enumerated from the adapter registry (new `backend.Types`, one `registry` slice
replacing `For`'s parallel union). `fakeacp` decodes both session requests through that member set,
so it drops what the pinned peer drops. R46 now labels `configOptions.currentValue` adapter
configuration evidence, not provider execution evidence, and FS-09.A15 cites the schema check while
leaving live honoring to gated A16. INV §12/§17 gained the BR-1 entries (INV §12/§17/§2).
`internal/runtime/acp_session_schema_test.go` holds both checks; the fake-peer one fails against the
pre-fix fake with `[model systemPrompt]`.

**Changelog — 2026-09-13 (fix: BR-1 live-gate durability):** Workflow §4 makes a failed acceptance
gate or live-provider check live state: recorded under `## Review findings` in the §7 format before
the role that ran it closes, with the archived run record as supporting evidence rather than the
only trace. A blocked state-file write leaves the role explicitly blocked under §3 instead of
archiving the finding, and a commit or review carrying an acceptance run record first reconciles
every Must-fix in it against the live findings. §16.6 repeats the rule where release acceptance
reports are produced. Documentation-only (INV §1/§10), so no code test applies; `make check-specs`
and `git diff --check` pass.

**Release state:** `v0.4.3` is published and verified on tag `8ad5261`. Release and CI runs passed,
the local distributable reports `0.4.3` with `sqlite_fts5`, and the GitHub Release carries the
darwin/arm64 archive, `install.sh`, and a manifest declaring `0.4.3` with its SHA-256.
The release shipped with five open Must-fix findings on the operator's explicit decision; all five
are now closed. The credentialed Claude and Codex journeys under
**Acceptance gates** are owed; real steering has never been exercised against a provider.

**Available by role:** `/review` has no unreviewed unit. `/work` may take
`rename-product-to-deckhand`; `/fix` may take BR-1;
`/design-feature` may choose an available or resumable idea. Queues are independent.

## Decisions needing your input

- **API/model compatibility:** TS-03.R3–R4 preserve mixed legacy error envelopes; TS-04.R3 records
  provider model-ID ownership. Standardizing either is a compatibility change.
- **Failed pipeline-stage chat:** Confirm whether a pause after a failed launch or resume should
  keep withholding **Open agent**, matching restart recovery (FS-14.R48), or whether chat should
  remain reachable with a wider continuation contract.

## Acceptance gates

**Not blocking as of 2026-09-05.** These gates have not been run, and no agent may describe them as
verified, passed, or closed. The operator chose to let roles proceed with them open.

- [ ] Pinned real-provider stage-result/file-edit approval journey (FS-03.A26/J14).
- [ ] Post-fix credentialed Claude and Codex chat, MCP, resume, task, effective-model/effort, and
      reported-result checks. The historical 2026-07-26 run failed model precedence and is evidence,
      not closure for the current implementation.
- [ ] Pinned Claude terminal flags/hooks and live xterm journeys.
- [ ] Pinned OpenCode/OpenHands launch and credential checks.
- [ ] Real macOS native folder-panel checks (FS-04.A22/J2/J9/J16).
- [ ] Real-browser permission-pane and drag-refusal journeys (FS-02.A35/A43).
- [ ] Phase 7 federation matrix against real Claude and Codex installations.
- [ ] Real-browser worktree creation/launch and archive-with-uncommitted-work journeys (FS-19).
- [ ] Six-tab same-origin dashboard check against a `make dist` build (FS-02.A27).

## Blocked on human

- None.

## Review findings

`persistent-pipeline-orchestration` closed on 2026-09-13: all fourteen findings are fixed with
regression tests, and the unit is no longer open for review or fixes.

### BR-1 — **Fix model:** difficult — Codex Sol.

- **Worth fixing** — equivalent OpenCode/OpenHands fields remain unverified (**undetermined**).
  **Where:** neither CLI is installed. OpenHands model delivery has a separate `LLM_MODEL` env path,
  so it does not depend on the suspect ACP `model` member, but both adapters still receive an
  out-of-schema top-level `systemPrompt`; OpenCode also still depends on the top-level `model`.
  **Why it matters:** the same silent-ignore class may be live on surfaces explicitly advertised by
  AgentDeck. **Requirement:** FS-09.A6, `INV §12`. **Suggested fix/test:** keep the claims gated until
  each pinned CLI is installed and its model/prompt delivery is checked at the effective provider;
  remove any redundant unsupported top-level fields once their real mechanism is known.

## Design consistency notes

- The paused direct-action change cites `TS-04.R32–R40`, while TS-01.R25 and TS-03.R32 cite
  `TS-04.R32–R39` and omit R40, the direct-action redaction clause. Align them when that change
  resumes.
- FS-17 §6's opening sentence should be scoped when its planned direct-cutover work resumes; it
  currently reads as covering a section that also contains planned R13–R19 boundaries.
