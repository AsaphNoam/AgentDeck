## Current position

- **Active change:** `persistent-pipeline-orchestration` is in progress under `/work`.
- **Release:** `v0.4.3` is tagged and published; **Release state** and the release record carry its
  contents. `v0.4.2` and earlier are in the state archive.
- **Review units:** `/review` has no available unit; every unit through this release is closed.
  `stop-telling-agents-to-poll` shipped without entering this queue on the operator's explicit
  2026-09-10 instruction; it can be added later.
- **Work units:** `persistent-pipeline-orchestration.md` is Waiting to start, including the completed
  deferred/inline mail technical contract. Its exact
  requirements and acceptance gates are in `docs/ready-changes/persistent-pipeline-orchestration.md`.
  `rename-product-to-deckhand.md` is Waiting to start: the AgentDeck → Deckhand rename with its
  one-time state migration, role rename to FirstMate, and two named read-compatibility paths.
  `migrate-internal-actions-from-mcp.md` stays paused on its transport
  blocker; the ACP wait-list in `docs/ideas.md` holds the rest behind an adapter contract.
  Queue hygiene: `bump-pinned-acp-adapters.md` reads `State: Finished` but is still in
  `docs/ready-changes/` and absent from that directory's index; per its README a finished change's
  file is removed. Left in place rather than deleted unasked.
- **Design units:** `Ideas being defined` entries may resume; `New ideas` entries are available.
  Persistent pipeline orchestration and its mail extension are fully specified and ready to implement.
  TS-01.R31–R33, TS-02.R34 and TS-04.R53 complete shared prompt preparation, bounded batches,
  transactional budget/read settlement, uncertain-delivery recovery and deferred retention.
  The clean legacy reset, descendant cancellation, project boundaries, subordinate stage
  coordination and ordinary stop/resume remain confirmed.
  Streaming agent thinking stays part-decided (live-only decided; rendering default and whether
  `plan` ships still open). The permanently unaddressable pipeline agent is the newest `New ideas`
  entry and needs `/design-feature` before code. The Deckhand rename is fully specified and promoted
  to the work queue; no design decision remains open for it.
- **Open findings:** The separate injected-steer lifetime edge case remains outside the closed
  host-owned fallback unit. Also open: live-gate finding durability, provider-contract oracles, and
  the unverified OpenCode/OpenHands paths. See **Review findings**.
- **Bug reports:** BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3 are investigated and archived with this release; BR-3 is
  fixed and closed. BR-1's Codex model/effort defect is fixed and reviewed; BR-2 is fixed and closed.
  BR-1's still-open findings are listed above. Pinned Claude model delivery
  through `_meta` works; an ACP model `currentValue` can be stale and is no execution-model oracle.
- **State:** The file viewer's credentialed rendered forms are owed: journey J3 now carries the
  file-link steps (docked and transcript-width forms, the refusal branch, the dashboard-pane
  navigation), and none of them has been exercised against a real browser.
  Automated MCP contract verification is green. The full post-fix Claude/Codex acceptance
  matrix remains open and must not be called verified; the 2026-09-08/09 probes were limited contract
  and model-delivery checks, not that matrix. Real Claude and Codex steering is unexercised.
- **Branch:** `main`.

## Active change

**Change:** `persistent-pipeline-orchestration`

**State:** In progress. Implementation started 2026-09-12 from the completed FS/TS contract.
The first slice is the shared bounded inline-mail preparation and settlement seam, followed by
durable task waiting/repair and the task-backed pipeline replacement.

**Changelog — 2026-09-12 (design-feature):** Completed the mail technical contract against existing
runtime and state seams: optional wake intent, shared bounded inline preparation, provider-result
confirmation, stable-id recovery without extra wakes, turn-budget reservation and deferred retention.
Added TS-01.R31–R33, TS-02.R34 and TS-04.R53; completed readiness references and moved the pipeline
unit to Waiting to start. Removed its completed source idea. Spec checks, twin-skill and diff checks
pass. No product code changed; implementation and provider acceptance remain future work.

**Changelog — 2026-09-12 (design-feature):** Drafted waking/deferred durable mail and bounded
inline delivery in FS-06.R30–R36/A20–A25, FS-00.R17 and FS-14.R78/A45. Withdrew the separate
coordinator-update queue and delivery watermark in TS-09.R50 / TS-10.R36; intervention awareness
uses ordinary deferred mail. The expanded pipeline unit is paused for unread deferred-mail
retention, feature confirmation and the matching technical contract. Spec checks, twin skills and
diff checks pass; no product code changed.

**Changelog — 2026-09-12 (fix):** Closed all four `file-read-nonregular-kind` findings. Added
socket and FIFO regressions that fail without the pre-open kind check instead of skipping on macOS,
moved the replacement hook into the real stat/open window, and split a contained-but-unopenable file
out of `path_refused` into a new `file_unreadable` refusal. Restated TS-05.R21 as
classify-through-the-root-then-open with `os.Root` authoritative over `withinRoot`; extended
FS-03.A37 and TS-03.R40. Classes 2, 8, 10, 17. File-read tests pass under `-race`; the paused
pipeline work's messaging/pipeline failures are pre-existing and unrelated.

**Changelog — 2026-09-12 (design-feature):** Revised persistent orchestration so the standing
agent always owns and reports the stage; configured dedicated coordinators are managed children and
the normal coordination contact, with durable awareness of material direct intervention. Cleanup
now automatically reconciles transient failures with persisted backoff and attention only for
persistent/unsafe conditions. Confirmed same-identity stop/resume and assignment re-delivery. Updated
FS-14.R61–R77/A35–A44, FS-16.R30–R38/A20–A24, TS-09.R35–R50, TS-10.R25–R37 and TS-05.R22;
R60 is superseded by R75. Promoted the source idea to the waiting ready change. Spec checks, twin
skills and diff checks pass; no product code changed and no implementation is active.

**Release state:** `v0.4.3` is published and verified on tag `8ad5261`. Release and CI runs passed,
the local distributable reports `0.4.3` with `sqlite_fts5`, and the GitHub Release carries the
darwin/arm64 archive, `install.sh`, and a manifest declaring `0.4.3` with its SHA-256.
The release shipped with five open Must-fix findings on the operator's explicit decision; all five
are now closed. The credentialed Claude and Codex journeys under
**Acceptance gates** are owed; real steering has never been exercised against a provider.

**Available by role:** `/review` has none; `/work` may take
`persistent-pipeline-orchestration` or `rename-product-to-deckhand`; `/fix` may take BR-1;
`/design-feature` may choose an available or resumable idea. Queues are independent.

## Decisions needing your input

- **API/model compatibility:** TS-03.R3–R4 preserve mixed legacy error envelopes; TS-04.R3 records
  provider model-ID ownership. Standardizing either is a compatibility change.
- **Failed pipeline-stage chat:** Confirm whether a pause after a failed launch or resume should
  keep withholding **Open agent**, matching restart recovery (FS-14.R48), or whether chat should
  remain reachable with a wider continuation contract.

## Acceptance gates

**Not blocking as of 2026-09-05.** These gates have not been run, and no agent may describe them as
verified, passed, or closed. The operator chose to let roles proceed with them open.

- [ ] Pinned real-provider stage-result/file-edit approval journey (FS-03.A26/J14).
- [ ] Post-fix credentialed Claude and Codex chat, MCP, resume, task, effective-model/effort, and
      reported-result checks. The historical 2026-07-26 run failed model precedence and is evidence,
      not closure for the current implementation.
- [ ] Pinned Claude terminal flags/hooks and live xterm journeys.
- [ ] Pinned OpenCode/OpenHands launch and credential checks.
- [ ] Real macOS native folder-panel checks (FS-04.A22/J2/J9/J16).
- [ ] Real-browser permission-pane and drag-refusal journeys (FS-02.A35/A43).
- [ ] Phase 7 federation matrix against real Claude and Codex installations.
- [ ] Real-browser worktree creation/launch and archive-with-uncommitted-work journeys (FS-19).
- [ ] Six-tab same-origin dashboard check against a `make dist` build (FS-02.A27).

## Blocked on human

- None.

## Review findings

### BR-1 — **Fix model:** difficult — Codex Sol.

- **Must fix** — BR-1 finding state was not durable across concurrent roles (**confirmed**).
  **Where:** `docs/archive/reviews/live-provider-acceptance-2026-07-26.md` recorded the exact Codex
  model failure as a Must-fix on July 26, but the live acceptance session could not edit HANDOFF
  while another session owned the shared docs. The report and a contradictory effort design were
  then swept into `7d294fb` without the finding entering HANDOFF. **Why it matters:** the mandatory
  read order made the archived report invisible to every later role, so an already-detected critical
  defect was treated as an open gate for another six weeks. **Requirement:** workflow §§1.1/12,
  `INV §1`, `INV §10`. **Suggested fix/test:** a failed live gate must be recorded in HANDOFF before
  its role can close; if state-file ownership blocks that write, leave the role explicitly blocked
  rather than archiving the only finding. A commit/review that contains an acceptance report must
  reconcile every Must-fix in it with live state.
- **Must fix** — provider-contract claims can still be proved by a self-authored oracle
  (**confirmed**). **Where:** TS-04.R18 asserted a `model[effort]` request shape after inspecting
  `codex-acp`'s internal `ModelId` parser without tracing `session/new` to `threadStart`; FS-09.A15
  and `fakeacp` then checked only that AgentDeck emitted the asserted field. The fake accepts unknown
  request members that the pinned ACP decoder drops. The same oracle error recurred in the 2026-09-08
  finding-fix: it called ACP `configOptions.model.currentValue` an independent effective-model oracle
  and declared Claude `_meta` delivery broken without sending a prompt. A real prompt then showed
  stale `currentValue = opus` alongside requested Haiku/Sonnet in SDK init, assistant, and usage
  signals. **Why it matters:** design, implementation, review, and an adapter-local readback can all
  agree and remain wrong about the external provider; following the false Claude finding would add a
  redundant delivery path and change launch failure/order behavior. **Requirement:** `INV §11`,
  `INV §12`, `INV §17`. **Suggested fix/test:** require provider-behavior statements to cite a
  complete reachability trace or a credentialed prompt receipt; label ACP `currentValue` as adapter
  configuration evidence, not provider execution evidence; and add an independently derived contract
  oracle that rejects out-of-schema standard fields instead of mirroring `sessionNewParams`.
- **Worth fixing** — equivalent OpenCode/OpenHands fields remain unverified (**undetermined**).
  **Where:** neither CLI is installed. OpenHands model delivery has a separate `LLM_MODEL` env path,
  so it does not depend on the suspect ACP `model` member, but both adapters still receive an
  out-of-schema top-level `systemPrompt`; OpenCode also still depends on the top-level `model`.
  **Why it matters:** the same silent-ignore class may be live on surfaces explicitly advertised by
  AgentDeck. **Requirement:** FS-09.A6, `INV §12`. **Suggested fix/test:** keep the claims gated until
  each pinned CLI is installed and its model/prompt delivery is checked at the effective provider;
  remove any redundant unsupported top-level fields once their real mechanism is known.

## Design consistency notes

- The paused direct-action change cites `TS-04.R32–R40`, while TS-01.R25 and TS-03.R32 cite
  `TS-04.R32–R39` and omit R40, the direct-action redaction clause. Align them when that change
  resumes.
- FS-17 §6's opening sentence should be scoped when its planned direct-cutover work resumes; it
  currently reads as covering a section that also contains planned R13–R19 boundaries.
