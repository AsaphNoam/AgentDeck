# AgentDeck — Implementation handoff

**Live agent state.** Read this first, then open the relevant requirements named below. Historical
phase state is archived in [`../archive/state/HANDOFF-pre-sdd.md`](../archive/state/HANDOFF-pre-sdd.md).
Follow [`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md) and keep this file limited to resumable current state.

## Current position

- **Review state:** Every finding from the review through `895348e` is closed. The two purported
  agent-facing `request_conflict` and `revision_conflict` codes were confirmed HTTP-only; the three
  MCP-reachable pipeline codes are classified and guarded.
- **Active change:** None. Agent-facing retry classification and structured result delivery is shipped;
  FS-17 and TS-04.R30–R31 are Current.
- **State:** Automated MCP contract verification is green. Pinned Claude/Codex live-provider checks
  remain owed before claiming those adapters accept structured results.
- **Last reviewed code:** `895348e` (2026-08-26).
- **Branch:** `main`.

## Active change

**State:** none in progress.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-26 — work:** `/work` found no active change and no waiting ready change, so no
  implementation started. The repository remains clean and ready for the next designed change.
- **2026-08-26 — fix:** Closed all nine review findings. Source evaluation now publishes and
  recursively propagates across pipeline and restart boundaries (INV §1/§10/§15); task start
  generations are confirmed at effect time and failed wake confirmation settles the attempt (INV
  §4/§5); context authorization has one transaction-safe predicate (INV §2); task and dashboard
  errors surface accurately (INV §8); and agent-tool retry coverage and its SDK boundary now match
  FS-17 (INV §10). The two review-named pipeline conflict codes are HTTP-only, not MCP refusals.
- **2026-08-26 — review:** Reviewed `e1e827b`, `b121fd0`, and `895348e` against FS-02, FS-16, FS-17,
  TS-03, TS-04, TS-05, TS-10, and every invariant class. Two **Must fix** and seven **Worth fixing**
  findings recorded below; `make check-specs`, the Go suite for the touched packages, `tsc --noEmit`,
  and `npm test` all pass, while `git diff --check` reports one trailing-whitespace line.
- **2026-08-26 — implementation:** Shipped the agent-facing tool result contract. Every MCP refusal
  now carries a centralized four-class retry hint, successful and refused JSON objects are mirrored
  into structured content without changing the text block, and registration-derived tests cover the
  complete tool surface and deferred output-schema boundary.
- **2026-08-25 — fix:** Closed all thirteen dependent-work review findings. Task starts now retain
  the runtime's true generation, cancellation and start serialize per task, failed dependencies
  propagate fully, dispatcher transitions publish after commit, failed cleanup retains ownership,
  attachment creation is atomic and bounded, and the Tasks UI and API cover their specified paths.
- **2026-08-25 — design:** Defined FS-17 (agent-facing tool result contract) and TS-04.R30–R31, and
  queued `docs/ready-changes/agent-tool-retry-classification.md`. Investigation of the "richer
  agent-facing orchestration API" idea found most of it already shipped; the remainder is trimmed in
  `../ideas.md`. The task-graph query exclusion (FS-16 §6, TS-04.R29) was reaffirmed by the user.

## Decisions needing your input

These are product decisions needed for a future change or shipped boundaries whose reversal needs
an explicit specification update. Remove an item when the human resolves it or queues that update.

- **API/model compatibility:** TS-03.R3–R4 preserve mixed legacy error envelopes; TS-04.R3 records
  provider model-ID ownership. Standardizing either is a compatibility change.

## Acceptance gates

- [ ] Run pinned, credentialed Claude and Codex chat/MCP/resume checks before claiming those combinations.
- [ ] Run pinned Claude terminal flags/hooks and live xterm journeys before claiming full terminal support.
- [ ] Run pinned OpenCode/OpenHands launch/credential checks before claiming those backends beyond fakes.
- [ ] Run J2 and J9 in a real macOS browser to confirm the native folder panel opens in front,
  selects, and cancels (FS-04.A22); component tests stand in until then.
- [ ] Run J5 in a real browser to confirm a right-click anywhere on the projects canvas — including
  the padding frame below and beside the cards — opens **New project** (FS-02.A24); the stylesheet
  assertion stands in until then.
- [ ] Run a task start, an assignment turn, and a reported result against the pinned Claude and Codex
      adapters before claiming dependent work works with real providers (FS-16 §6).
- [ ] Run one successful and one refused MCP tool call through pinned Claude and Codex adapters before
      claiming they accept structured tool results without losing the text block (FS-17.A6).
- [ ] Run the Phase 7 federation discovery/precedence/refresh/launch/resume matrix against real Claude and
  Codex installations before promoting FS-08/TS-07 from Partial.

## Blocked on human

Live-provider acceptance is waiting for human authorization because it invokes real provider sessions
and creates disposable local configuration homes. On 2026-07-15 this machine has Claude Code 2.1.202,
the retired `claude-code-acp`, Codex CLI 0.142.5, and `codex-acp` 1.1.2 installed; the new
`claude-agent-acp`, OpenCode, and OpenHands are not installed globally.

## Review findings

None.
