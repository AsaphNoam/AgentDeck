# AgentDeck — Implementation handoff

**Live agent state.** Read the **Current position** and **Active change** below, then open the
requirements they name. Open the other sections only when those point at them. Settled state is
archived in [`../archive/state/HANDOFF-through-2026-09-03.md`](../archive/state/HANDOFF-through-2026-09-03.md)
and [`../archive/state/HANDOFF-pre-sdd.md`](../archive/state/HANDOFF-pre-sdd.md). Follow
[`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md); this file holds resumable current state only and is cut
back to that at every release (§16.7). Injected Current position plus Active change budget: 8 KiB.

## Current position

- **Active change:** None. The workflow repair requested on 2026-09-04 is implemented and verified.
- **Release:** `v0.4.0` is published and verified on tag `5485cd7`. Credentialed Claude/Codex checks
  remain owed under TS-06.R21. A customized `agentdecker` role is deliberately not migrated under
  FS-04.R44, so it keeps the superseded product manual beside the current skill.
- **Review state:** The pre-2026-09-04 raw commit queue is retired. Its substantive changes were
  reviewed and their findings are closed; its later review records, finding-fix commits, release
  records, and handoff/queue bookkeeping are administrative closure, not new review units. The only
  eligible unit awaiting independent review is the 2026-09-04 workflow repair that introduced this
  change-unit model and cleaned this handoff. Do not review an older administrative commit or start
  a later unit out of order.
- **Open findings:** None.
- **State:** Automated MCP contract verification is green. Pinned Claude/Codex live-provider checks
  remain owed before claiming those adapters accept structured results.
- **Usability state:** The Pipelines pages and dashboard grid were driven through a real Chromium on
  2026-08-30 against a `make dist` build of the shipped tree; that run is closed except for the
  acceptance gates below.
- **Branch:** `main`.

## Active change

**Change:** None.

**Next:** Independently review the 2026-09-04 workflow repair once. A no-finding review closes it
without creating another review obligation; any findings and their fixes remain part of that same
unit. After it closes, the proposal Reject/Delete change is ready to start as
[`decline-pipeline-proposals.md`](../ready-changes/decline-pipeline-proposals.md). Its ordering
decision is settled and must not be reopened during implementation. Keep credentialed provider
journeys as acceptance gates until a human authorizes real sessions.

## Changelog

Earlier entries are in the [archived handoff](../archive/state/HANDOFF-through-2026-09-03.md) and Git
history.

- **2026-09-04 — design: task launch-specification effort (FS-16.R27–R28, FS-09.R49, TS-10.R23):**
  Specified an optional reasoning effort on a task's launch specification, offered by `create_task`,
  `POST /api/tasks`, and the Tasks create form, stored on the task row and applied as FS-09.R41's
  explicit request when the task's agent is launched. The same design validates a task's backend,
  model, and effort at creation instead of letting a bad specification spend all three start
  attempts, and rejects an effort supplied with an existing-agent target. FS-16 and TS-10 moved to
  Partial; the work is queued as `docs/ready-changes/task-launch-effort.md` and is not active.
- **2026-09-04 — workflow repair: terminal review units (INV §10):** Review state now follows a
  substantive change from implementation through its review findings and fixes. Review reports,
  finding-fix commits, release records, and handoff/archive/queue bookkeeping cannot re-enter the
  default review queue; default reviews take the earliest eligible unit only, and an empty queue
  produces no state commit. Claude and Codex launchers carry the same rules, and the launcher check
  enforces the exclusions, ordered selection, no-op exit, fix closure, and twin parity. The stale raw
  commit ledger and settled finding were removed from this handoff.

## Decisions needing your input

These are product decisions needed for a future change or shipped boundaries whose reversal needs
an explicit specification update. Remove an item when the human resolves it or queues that update.

- **API/model compatibility:** TS-03.R3–R4 preserve mixed legacy error envelopes; TS-04.R3 records
  provider model-ID ownership. Standardizing either is a compatibility change.
- **Failed pipeline-stage chat:** Confirm whether a pause after a failed launch or resume should
  keep withholding **Open agent**, matching restart recovery (FS-14.R48), or whether the chat should
  remain reachable with a wider continuation contract.
- **Refused card drag feedback:** Confirm whether the cross-block refusal should remain an in-flight
  pointer signal (FS-02.R53) or whether snap-back alone is the intended behavior. The shipped pointer
  implementation is still owed its real-browser computed-cursor pass, which is an acceptance gate below.
- **Detecting a pipeline stage that can no longer advance:** A run parked at `await_result` with a
  silent stage agent is invisible today, and that cost the 2026-09-02 report about nineteen hours.
  Fixing it needs your call on what qualifies, because a stage agent legitimately ends many turns
  while its delegated children work: an idle stage agent with no running delegated tasks, an elapsed
  time threshold, or an explicit heartbeat from the stage. Also say whether the result is a new
  attention reason under FS-14.R29 — which puts it in the same notification category as blocked and
  crash — or a weaker run-page disclosure like FS-14.R40's delegated-agent count.
- **How long a stopped agent stays unaddressable after its pipeline stage:** FS-06.R22 excludes
  pipeline-associated agents from the addressable set while stopped, and the association is a
  `pipeline_attempts` row that lives as long as its run record. So an agent that ran one stage of a
  run that finished weeks ago can never be sent a message or a task again unless someone resumes it
  or deletes the run. The rule's stated reason — a pipeline stage agent was deliberately stopped by
  its state machine, so no message may revive it — only applies while that state machine still owns
  it. Confirm that the permanent version is intended, or scope the exclusion to a run that is still
  active, which changes FS-06.R22 and `stoppedWakeGates`.
- **Reactivating a worktree project after a consented checkout deletion:** FS-19 did not say what
  happens, and the review found its two paths answered in opposite ways. The smaller reading shipped
  on 2026-09-02 and is now stated in FS-19 §3: accepting the deletion ends AgentDeck's ownership, so
  restoring the project later gives an ordinary missing-directory error and nothing is recreated —
  recreating a checkout the person just chose to delete would undo their decision, and the branch is
  still there to fork again from. Confirm, or say that restore should re-materialize the checkout,
  which needs the ownership row to survive the deletion.

## Acceptance gates

Gates closed on or before 2026-08-30 are in the archived handoff.

- [ ] Run FS-03.A26/J14 with a pinned real chat provider: an AgentDeck stage-result action proceeds
  without a prompt, a file edit still prompts, and approval after more than three minutes continues
  the same stage. Automated exact-identity, fail-closed, no-default-deadline, and attention checks
  pass; this rendered provider boundary needs human authorization.
- [ ] Run pinned, credentialed Claude and Codex chat/MCP/resume checks before claiming those combinations.
- [ ] Run pinned Claude terminal flags/hooks and live xterm journeys before claiming full terminal support.
- [ ] Run pinned OpenCode/OpenHands launch/credential checks before claiming those backends beyond fakes.
- [ ] Run J2/J9/J16 in a real macOS browser to confirm the native folder panel opens in front,
  selects, and cancels (FS-04.A22). Narrowed on 2026-08-27: a real browser confirmed the **Browse…**
  controls are present and enabled for `cwd` and the pending `add_dirs` entry in both the Settings
  project form and the New project modal, and that the onboarding wizard renders styled. Only the
  native `osascript` panel itself is still unverified, and it needs a human at the machine.
- [ ] Drive a chat agent into a permission request with the dashboard on screen in a real browser
  and confirm its pane opens by itself, that only the rows below it move and no card changes column
  (FS-02.R55/A43, J5), that a reload with that agent still waiting opens nothing, and that a fifth
  waiting agent's eviction of the least-recently-used pane is visible rather than silent with the
  evicted draft returning on re-expansion. jsdom evaluates no layout, so unit cases cannot close this.
- [ ] Drag a running card over the stopped block in a real browser and confirm the computed cursor
  on the card under the pointer states the refusal, clears when the pointer returns to its own block,
  and clears when the drag ends (FS-02.A35, J5). jsdom evaluates no CSS, so unit cases cover only the
  marked state and stylesheet rule.
- [ ] Run a task start, an assignment turn, and a reported result against the pinned Claude and Codex
  adapters before claiming dependent work works with real providers (FS-16 §6).
- [ ] Run one successful and one refused MCP tool call through pinned Claude and Codex adapters before
  claiming they accept structured tool results without losing the text block (FS-17.A6).
- [ ] Run the Phase 7 federation discovery/precedence/refresh/launch/resume matrix against real Claude
  and Codex installations before promoting FS-08/TS-07 from Partial.
- [ ] Run J16's worktree steps in a real browser against a `make dist` build (FS-19.A1, FS-02.A42):
  the card-menu and scoped-header entry points, the pre-filled creation form, the new card appearing
  with its branch without a manual refresh, and an agent launched into the new checkout. The API half
  was driven end to end against a real repository with the built binary on 2026-09-02; only the
  rendered surface is unverified.
- [ ] Run FS-19.A4's manual gate: archive a worktree project holding uncommitted work in a real
  browser and confirm the dialog defaults to keeping, names the uncommitted state, and that accepting
  removes the checkout while the branch survives.
- [ ] Run the six-tab same-origin dashboard check against a `make dist` build (FS-02.A27). The
  transport half is covered by `ui/src/api/sse.test.ts`; the browser half has never been run against
  a build carrying the shared stream. `scripts/stress-fixture` (TS-06 §6) is the fixture.

## Blocked on human

Live-provider acceptance is waiting for human authorization because it invokes real provider sessions
and creates disposable local configuration homes. On 2026-07-15 this machine has Claude Code 2.1.202,
the retired `claude-code-acp`, Codex CLI 0.142.5, and `codex-acp` 1.1.2 installed; the new
`claude-agent-acp`, OpenCode, and OpenHands are not installed globally.

## Review findings

None.

## Design consistency notes

- The paused direct-action change cites `TS-04.R32–R40`, while TS-01.R25 and TS-03.R32 cite
  `TS-04.R32–R39` and omit R40, the direct-action redaction clause. One range is wrong; align them
  when that paused change resumes.
- FS-17 §6 opens with “The contract is shipped. Live-provider compatibility remains tracked as
  acceptance gate A6,” which reads as covering the whole section, but §6 also carries the planned
  direct-cutover boundary for R13–R19. Scope the opening sentence when that planned work resumes.
